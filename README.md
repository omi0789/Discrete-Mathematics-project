Dijkstra Shortest Path Visualizer (Python)
This project is a Python-based implementation of Dijkstra’s algorithm, designed to visualize the process of finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. The visualizer allows users to input a start node and an end node, and the program dynamically calculates and displays the shortest path from the start to the destination.

Key Features:

* Interactive Graph Input: Users can define the nodes and edges of the graph, including the weights of each edge.
* Visual Representation: The algorithm’s execution is visually represented step-by-step, with nodes and edges highlighted as the algorithm progresses.
* Shortest Path Output: Once the shortest path is determined, the visualizer highlights the path from the start node to the end node, showing the minimum cost.

The project demonstrates the application of Dijkstra's algorithm in finding the shortest path in a weighted graph and provides an intuitive and educational tool for understanding the algorithm’s operation.
